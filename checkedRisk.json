    "title": "Apache-2.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive license that allows software to be used, modified, and distributed with very few restrictions, primarily requiring attribution and retention of notices. It does not impose copyleft obligations. The context supports this with references to similar permissive licenses having low risk levels, and the specific detail on the termination of patent rights under litigation does not significantly increase the overall risk level when considering the permissive nature of this license."

    "title": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license allows for broad distribution and modification of the licensed material, it still requires attribution to the original creator, which imposes a condition that must be followed. The absence of copyleft obligations lowers the risk compared to copyleft licenses like CC-BY-NC-SA, but the necessity to provide attribution and potential complications surrounding the use of the material (if combined with other works or under different legal frameworks) raise the overall risk level to medium. Given that other CC licenses exhibit very high risk levels due to their strong copyleft effects, it is important to view CC-BY-4.0 as having a significant but manageable level of risk."

  {
    "title": "3: MITâ‡§",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is widely recognized as a permissive license that imposes very few restrictions on the use of the software. The primary obligations are to include the original copyright notice and the license text. This lack of copyleft obligations and minimal requirements significantly reduces legal risks associated with compliance. The previous review accurately categorized the risk level as low."
