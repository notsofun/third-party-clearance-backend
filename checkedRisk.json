    "title": "Apache-2.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive license that facilitates broad usage and distribution without significant obligations beyond attribution and inclusion of the license text. The risks associated with it are generally low, particularly as it does not impose copyleft requirements and provides a clear and flexible framework for contributions and modifications. Additionally, the potential termination of patent licenses stems from litigation initiated by the licensee, which is a condition rather than an inherent risk of the license itself."

    "title": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license allows for wide usage and distribution without copyleft obligations, it still requires attribution to the original creator. This can pose risks in terms of compliance, as failure to provide proper attribution can lead to legal disputes. Additionally, unlike more permissive licenses like CC0, the requirement for attribution could lead to complications in various types of derivative works and their distribution. Given these considerations, a medium risk level is more appropriate than low."

    "title": "3: MITâ‡§",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is a permissive license that allows for extensive freedom in using, modifying, and distributing software with minimal obligations. The only requirements are to include the original copyright and permission notice, which poses a low risk for license compatibility and obligations. The previous assessment aligns with the established understanding of the risks associated with this license type."
