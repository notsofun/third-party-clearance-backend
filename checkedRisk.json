    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache 2.0 license is recognized as a permissive license, similar to its predecessor, Apache 1.1, which also carries a low risk level. It does not impose copyleft obligations, and the key requirements for compliance are to display the license text and acknowledge copyrights. Given the context, where multiple similar permissive licenses were evaluated as low risk, it supports the conclusion that Apache 2.0 remains a low-risk license."

    "title": "2: CC-BY-4.0⇧",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "The CC-BY-4.0 license indeed allows for sharing and adaptation with attribution, which is generally seen as low risk. However, this license does not contain copyleft provisions, which can lead to potential risks in certain contexts where derivative works are involved. Given the context of several 'CC-BY-NC-SA' licenses being rated very high due to significant copyleft implications, it is prudent to elevate the risk level to medium, acknowledging the balance between flexibility and the variance of implementation in derivative works."

    "title": "3: MIT⇧",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is a quintessential permissive license, which imposes minimal requirements on redistribution, limited to displaying the license text and copyrights. Its lack of copyleft obligations minimizes legal risks associated with usage and redistribution. The consensus in the context further supports the low risk assessment, as similar permissive licenses like MIT-CMU, EDL-1.0, and others are consistently evaluated as low risk for the same reasons."
