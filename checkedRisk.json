    "title": "Apache-2.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache-2.0 License is a permissive license that allows for both modification and redistribution of code without copyleft obligations. It requires minimal compliance measures, such as maintaining copyright notices and a copy of the license, which aligns with the previous assessment of low risk. Additionally, the provisions regarding patent rights are standard for such licenses. Therefore, the assessed risk level remains appropriate."

    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY-4.0) allows sharing and adaptation of works with relatively few restrictions, it still requires proper attribution and may lead to complex situations regarding derivatives and modifications. The license does not impose copyleft requirements like some other Creative Commons licenses (e.g., CC-BY-NC-SA), which could lead to confusion in downstream usage and the attribution requirements may lead to compliance challenges. Therefore, the risk level should be assessed as medium rather than low."

    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is recognized as a permissive open-source license, allowing users to use, modify, and distribute the software with minimal restrictions. The only conditions are that the copyright notice and permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. It does not impose any copyleft obligations, meaning that derivative works can be licensed under different terms without needing to disclose their source code. As such, the risk of legal complications is relatively low, aligning with the previous assessment of a low-risk level."
