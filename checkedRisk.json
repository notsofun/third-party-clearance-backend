    "title": "1: Apache-2.0⇧",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache License 2.0 is indeed a permissive license that allows broad use, modification, and distribution of the software with few obligations, primarily focused on providing attribution and accompanying license conditions. There are no strong copyleft requirements, which aligns with the previous assessment of a low risk level. Furthermore, the risk of patent termination in cases of litigation is relatively low because it applies only under specific circumstances. Therefore, the risk assessment remains unchanged."

    "title": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license allows broad usage and sharing, it mandates attribution, which can introduce complications in compliance, especially in commercial contexts. Moreover, compared to other CC licenses that impose stricter copyleft obligations like the NC-SA variants, CC-BY-4.0 does not impose copyleft obligations, making it relatively safer, but the attribution requirement can lead to unintentional misattributions or disputes. Therefore, it carries a higher risk level than initially assessed."

  {
    "title": "3: MIT⇧",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is a well-known permissive license that allows for reuse with minimal restrictions. Its requirements primarily involve the inclusion of the copyright notice and permission notice in redistributions, which are straightforward obligations. Given its permissive nature and absence of copyleft provisions, it poses a low risk for developers and users in terms of compliance and legal liabilities. The previous review accurately assessed this risk level as low."
