    "Justification": "The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive license that allows for wide usage, modification, and redistribution of the licensed work. It does impose some basic obligations like providing a copy of the license and proper attribution, but does not have strong copyleft requirements that would typically elevate the risk level. The analysis of the additional context confirms that the Apache License is associated with low risk in terms of obligations imposed on users and the ability to integrate it with proprietary software."

    "title": "2: CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "The CC-BY-4.0 license allows for broad usage, including modification and distribution of derivative works as long as proper attribution is given. While it does not impose copyleft obligations typical of other Creative Commons licenses like NC-SA, this license still has potential risks. The lack of copyleft creates a situation where the modified versions can be taken proprietary or misused in ways that do not honor the original authors' intentions. Additionally, compared to other versions of Creative Commons licenses that impose significant restrictions, CC-BY-4.0 does entail liabilities concerning attribution and proper usage that necessitate caution, justifying a medium risk level."

    "title": "MIT",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is widely regarded as a permissive license without copyleft obligations. It allows users the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software with minimal restrictions. The only requirements are to include the original copyright notice and the license text, which is a standard practice that does not introduce significant legal risks. Therefore, the original assessment of low risk is validated."
