    "title": "Apache-2.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "The Apache-2.0 license allows for broad use and modification without many restrictions, placing it in the category of permissive licenses. However, it includes a patent termination clause that could pose risks if the licensee engages in patent litigation. This aspect makes it more than just low risk, warranting a reevaluation to medium risk as there are significant implications concerning patent claims and litigation that users need to be aware of."

    "title": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license allows for usage and modification without copyleft obligations, the attribution requirement and irrevocable nature of the license impose certain responsibilities on users. Additionally, non-compliance can lead to the termination of rights, which elevates risk for users who may inadvertently violate the terms. Compared to other licenses that have higher restrictions, such as CC-BY-NC-SA variants, this license has a moderate risk level due to the necessity of proper attribution and potential consequences for misuse."

    "title": "3: MITâ‡§",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is widely recognized as a permissive open-source license, allowing for significant freedom in using, modifying, and distributing the licensed software without imposing copyleft obligations. The primary obligation is to retain the copyright notice and the license text in all copies of the software, which presents a low risk exposure for users and organizations. The lack of warranty and liability exclusions further align with the low-risk classification, as they protect the authors from legal claims. Therefore, the initial risk level assessment of 'low' is validated as appropriate."
