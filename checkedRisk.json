    "title": "Apache-2.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache License 2.0 is indeed a permissive license without copyleft obligations, allowing broad use, modification, and distribution of the software. The main requirements involve providing proper attribution and maintaining license notices. The context corroborates the absence of copyleft effects, with references to obligations that are characterized as low-risk. Moreover, while there is a notable condition regarding patent litigation that could terminate licenses, this condition does not substantially elevate the overall risk given the overall permissive nature of the license."

    "title": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The CC-BY-4.0 license allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute the licensed material as long as they provide proper attribution. There are no copyleft obligations tied to this license, meaning that downstream users are not required to share their modifications under the same license. This flexibility and permissiveness for usage does justify the low risk level assigned. While the context provided refers to other licenses with 'nearly unlimited copy left effect' indicating high risk, CC-BY-4.0 stands out as a permissive and non-restrictive license, further supporting the original low risk assessment."

  {
    "title": "3: MITâ‡§",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is a well-known permissive open-source license that allows for extensive use, modification, and distribution of the software without stringent obligations. The only requirements are to include the original copyright notice and permission notice in copies of the software. This aligns with the previous review's assessment of a low risk level, as it poses minimal legal obstacles and is widely adopted in the open-source community, which further supports the low risk classification."
