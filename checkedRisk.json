    "title": "Apache-2.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache-2.0 license is a permissive license that allows for software use, reproduction, modification, and distribution with minimal obligations. It primarily requires that the license text and copyright notices be retained, and it does not include copyleft provisions that could impose additional restrictions on users. The considerations regarding patent rights are reasonable and common in such licenses. Thus, the low risk assessment is appropriate given its permissive nature."

    "title": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license does allow for sharing and adaptation with attribution and imposes no copyleft obligations, it does require proper attribution and can lead to misunderstandings about the original creator's rights. The context provided shows that other similar licenses have been rated as very high risk due to their copyleft characteristics. The absence of copyleft in CC-BY-4.0 generally lowers its risk but does warrant being rated at medium due to the need for careful attribution and potential implications of mixing different licenses."

    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is a permissive open-source license that allows users to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software with minimal restriction. It does not impose any copyleft obligations, meaning that derivative works can be licensed under different terms. This characteristic of the license significantly lowers the risk of legal complications compared to licenses containing copyleft provisions. The previous review correctly assessed the risk level as low based on its permissive nature and lack of onerous obligations."
