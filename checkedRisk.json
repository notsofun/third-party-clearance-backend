    "title": "1: Apache-2.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache-2.0 license is a permissive license that allows for extensive freedom in using, modifying, and distributing code. It does not impose copyleft requirements, which reduces the risk of license compliance issues. The analysis presented in the context supports this assessment, showing that similar permissive licenses consistently maintain a low-risk classification. The obligations include displaying the license text and copyrights, which are minimal, further justifying the low-risk level."

  {
    "title": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license allows for sharing and modification without copyleft requirements, it does impose obligations for attribution. The assessment of 'low' risk may understate the importance of compliance with attribution requirements, which can lead to legal issues if misunderstood or neglected. Given the stronger restrictions seen in similar licenses like CC-BY-NC-SA-* (which have 'very high' risk due to strong copyleft effects), it is prudent to classify CC-BY-4.0 as 'medium' risk due to its non-copyleft nature but necessary compliance for attribution."
  },
  {
    "title": "3: MITâ‡§",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT license is a well-known permissive license that imposes minimal restrictions on reuse, primarily requiring attribution and the inclusion of the original license text. The provided context supports the low risk assessment by indicating that similar permissive licenses, including MIT, share this characteristic. There are no copyleft obligations that would impose additional risks, thus maintaining the low risk level."
