    "title": "1: Apache-2.0⇧",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache License 2.0 is indeed a permissive license, allowing for broad use, distribution, and modification with minimal obligations. It does not impose copyleft conditions and rather facilitates the integration of licensed code into proprietary software. The reasoning provided by the previous reviewer aligns with established assessments of the Apache 2.0's risk profile, which is considered low, especially when no modifications are made. Additionally, the context confirms the permissive nature and the lack of copyleft obligations, reinforcing that the original assessment was accurate."

    "title": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license permits broad usage and modification of licensed materials, it still imposes certain obligations, primarily the requirement for attribution. This creates a moderate risk as it can lead to confusion over proper attribution and misuse of works, especially when derivative works proliferate. Given that there are other Creative Commons licenses with similar structures that have been rated as very high risk due to 'nearly unlimited copyleft effects', it is more appropriate to assess CC-BY-4.0 at a medium risk level instead of low."

    "title": "3: MIT⇧",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is a permissive open-source license that allows for wide use, modification, and distribution of the software with minimal restrictions. The only obligations are to retain the copyright notice and the license text in copies or substantial portions of the software. As such, it does not impose copyleft requirements, making it a lower-risk choice in terms of compliance and legal obligations. The risk level assessment of 'low' is appropriate given the nature of this license."
