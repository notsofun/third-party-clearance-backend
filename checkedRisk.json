    "title": "Apache-2.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache License 2.0 is indeed a permissive license that does not impose strong copyleft obligations, allowing users to modify, redistribute, and use the software with minimal restrictions. The obligations primarily require attribution and the retention of notices, which are common in permissive licenses. Further context indicates that even in scenarios where no code changes are performed, the risk remains low due to the clear structure of the license, which helps mitigate potential liability concerns. Therefore, the original assessment of low risk is validated."

    "title": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license does allow for broad use and modification, the 'Attribution' condition requires users to credit the original creators. This can introduce moderate risk if not properly managed, as attribution errors can lead to legal disputes. Additionally, considering that other similar licenses (like CC-BY-NC-SA) are rated as very high risk due to more restrictive obligations, a medium risk level seems more appropriate to account for the obligations associated with attribution."

    "title": "MIT",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is recognized as a permissive open-source license that allows users to perform almost any action with the software, including usage, modification, and distribution, as long as the original copyright notice is included. The lack of copyleft obligations significantly lowers the risk of compliance issues, as it imposes minimal restrictions on how the software can be used. The previous review correctly identified the risk as low, supported by additional context indicating that similar permissive licenses also carry low risk."
