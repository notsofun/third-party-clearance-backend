    "Justification": "The Apache License 2.0 is indeed a permissive license that allows for a wide range of freedoms including reproduction, modification, and distribution without imposing copyleft obligations. It requires minimal compliance such as retaining notices and providing the license text but does not pose significant legal risks. The existing evaluation correctly identifies the low risk associated with this license, as it does not present strong restrictions or obligations that could lead to complex legal challenges.",

    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license allows for redistribution and adaptation with attribution, it still imposes obligations on users, particularly regarding attribution and possible moral rights. Additionally, the license's irrevocability can pose risks if the original licensor changes terms for their other works or decides to withdraw permission for certain uses. These factors elevate the risk compared to a completely permissive license, hence a medium risk assessment is warranted rather than low.",

    "title": "3: MIT⇧",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is a well-established permissive open-source license that allows users to freely use, copy, modify, and redistribute software without any major restrictions, as long as the copyright notice and permission notice are included. The absence of copyleft obligations minimizes risk by allowing proprietary use, which is reflected in the assessments of other similar licenses in the context. The general understanding within the open-source community confirms that permissive licenses like MIT typically carry a low risk level.",
