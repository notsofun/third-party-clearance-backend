    "Justification": "The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive open-source license, allowing for free use, modification, and distribution of the software without imposing significant obligations. The reasoning provided for a 'low' risk assessment is consistent with its permissive nature and absence of copyleft requirements. Additionally, the necessary obligations under the license, such as providing attribution and including the license text, do not impose substantial risks to users or distributors, thus maintaining a low risk level.",

    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license does allow for attribution without copyleft obligations, the necessity to give credit and the irrevocable nature of the license means that once material is shared under this license, it cannot be retracted. This can pose risks when combined with derivative works, where the attribution requirement may complicate usage in various contexts. Moreover, the comparisons with other Creative Commons licenses exhibiting higher risk levels indicate a nuanced understanding of how different CC licenses operate, suggesting that CC-BY-4.0 carries a greater risk profile than a 'low' rating may suggest.",

    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is a widely recognized permissive open-source license that allows for extensive freedoms in using, copying, modifying, and distributing the licensed software. It imposes minimal obligations, such as the requirement to include the original copyright notice and the permission notice in all substantial copies, without requiring any changes to be shared under the same license (i.e., no copyleft obligations). This permissiveness reduces potential legal risks, hence maintaining a low risk level for users and businesses. The context provided, including references to other permissive licenses with similar characteristics, supports this classification.",
