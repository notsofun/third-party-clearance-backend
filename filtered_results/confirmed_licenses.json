    "Justification": "While CC-BY-4.0 does allow for wide distribution and modification of works, it requires attribution to the original creator, which adds a layer of obligation to users compared to completely permissive licenses. Additionally, the absence of copyleft obligations might create moderate risks regarding the use of licensed materials in commercial applications without proper acknowledgement. The context provided shows that other similar licenses with 'non-commercial' clauses have been assessed at a very high risk level due to their limitations, indicating that even 4.0 versions could present more than a low risk in practice, particularly in commercial contexts.",

    "Justification": "The MIT license is indeed a permissive license that does not impose copyleft obligations. This means it allows individuals to use, modify, and distribute the software freely with minimal requirements, such as including the license text and displaying copyrights. The risk is primarily low as it does not create obligations that could lead to legal complications or restrictive interpretations, making it one of the most developer-friendly licenses available.",
