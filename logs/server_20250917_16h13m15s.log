Furthermore, you may be required to certify the deletion/destruction (if required by the licensor).\n- You must not assign or transfer the license, the license agreement or the component without the licensor\'s prior written consent.\n\n### Development obligations and restrictions\n\n- You must ensure that all involved team members and subcontractors comply with all applicable obligations and restrictions of the license agreement (e.g. to keep confidential information non-disclosed, e.g. no unauthorized use of the software).\n- You must use a backup copy only to replace a defective original copy.\n- You must not use the component or the licensed software to develop an application that competes with the component or the licensed software.\n- You must not use a trial, beta or demo version of the component for any other use than for evaluation purposes.\n\n### Distribution obligations and restrictions\n\n- You must not deliver proprietary Source Code except when explicitly mentioned in this Protocol and/or after prior written consent of the copyright owner and/or licensor.\n- You must not add commercial license agreements/ contracts to the Readme_OSS file except when explicitly requested.\n- You must not subject the component to any kind of Open Source license (in whole or in part).\n- You must not create obligations or representations on behalf of the licensor.\n- In case, the license allows you to transfer single license rights and/or the entire license agreement, you must bind the recipient/assignee to the license agreement before such transfer and transfer all copies of the component including all parts, material and documents.\n\n Would you mind telling me if it meets your requirements?']
