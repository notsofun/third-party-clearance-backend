Human: Objective: The chatbot is tasked with confirming whether the user has proper authorization for commercial components that require licensing, and identifying any additional commercial components that may need authorization.

Instruction: "Please verify with the user whether they have valid licenses for the identified commercial components and check if there are any additional commercial components requiring authorization. Your result should be 'continue' if you need more information from the user, or 'next' if the user has provided complete authorization status. In the talking field, list the commercial components requiring authorization and ask the user to confirm their licensing status."

Expected Output Example:

  "result": "continue",
  "talking": "I've identified the following commercial components that require valid licenses: [Component A, Component B, Component C]. Commercial software licenses are essential for legal compliance and avoiding potential legal risks. Please confirm: 1) Do you have valid licenses for all these components? 2) Are there any other commercial components in your project that might require licensing? Please provide the authorization status for each component."

For code that is intended to be used in Siemens products or services, the code generation features of our AI Services may only be used after prior approval of your responsible organizational unit.
Guidance for Implementation:

Initial Listing: Clearly list all identified commercial components that require licensing, making it easy for the user to review.

Authorization Check: Ask the user to confirm the licensing status for each component, encouraging specific responses about which components are licensed and which are not.

Additional Components: Proactively ask if there are other commercial components not yet identified that might require licensing.

Response Evaluation:

If the user provides complete authorization status for all components and confirms no additional components, set result to "next"
If the user's response is incomplete or unclear, set result to "continue" and ask for specific clarification
Output Format: Always respond in the strict JSON format with only the two fields: result and talking.
AI: ```json

Your expertise includes identifying, analyzing, and providing guidance on Open Source Software (OSS) and Proprietary Software (PSS) components within contracts, documentation, and software projects.

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Analyze documents for OSS and PSS compliance risks
- Identify potential license violations and contractual issues
- Provide recommendations for compliance remediation
- Guide users through systematic compliance clearance processes

**Operational Mode System:**
You operate in different modes based on user instructions. The user will send mode-switching commands, and you must determine whether to:
- **CONTINUE**: Stay in the current mode to gather more information
- **NEXT**: Move to the next mode when sufficient information has been collected

**Response Format:**
You MUST respond in strict JSON format for every interaction:

```json
  "result": "continue" | "next",
  "talking": "Your normal response content here"
```

Decision Criteria:

Choose "continue" when you need more details, clarification, or additional information to complete the current mode's objectives
Choose "next" when you have gathered sufficient information to proceed to the subsequent mode or task
Key Areas of Expertise:

Human: Objective: The chatbot is tasked with confirming whether the user has proper authorization for commercial components that require licensing, and identifying any additional commercial components that may need authorization.

Instruction: "Please verify with the user whether they have valid licenses for the identified commercial components and check if there are any additional commercial components requiring authorization. Your result should be 'continue' if you need more information from the user, or 'next' if the user has provided complete authorization status. In the talking field, list the commercial components requiring authorization and ask the user to confirm their licensing status."

Expected Output Example:

  "result": "continue",
  "talking": "I've identified the following commercial components that require valid licenses: [Component A, Component B, Component C]. Commercial software licenses are essential for legal compliance and avoiding potential legal risks. Please confirm: 1) Do you have valid licenses for all these components? 2) Are there any other commercial components in your project that might require licensing? Please provide the authorization status for each component."

For code that is intended to be used in Siemens products or services, the code generation features of our AI Services may only be used after prior approval of your responsible organizational unit.
Guidance for Implementation:

Initial Listing: Clearly list all identified commercial components that require licensing, making it easy for the user to review.

Authorization Check: Ask the user to confirm the licensing status for each component, encouraging specific responses about which components are licensed and which are not.

Additional Components: Proactively ask if there are other commercial components not yet identified that might require licensing.

Response Evaluation:

If the user provides complete authorization status for all components and confirms no additional components, set result to "next"
If the user's response is incomplete or unclear, set result to "continue" and ask for specific clarification
Output Format: Always respond in the strict JSON format with only the two fields: result and talking.
AI: ```json
{
  "result": "continue",
  "talking": "I've identified the following commercial components that require valid licenses: [@ngrx/store, along with its dependencies].

Human: # Special License Check Prompt

## Objective
The chatbot is tasked with conducting specialized license compliance checks based on the specific license category. These special checks involve verifying that users have implemented the appropriate technical measures and provided required documentation for compliance with various license types.

## Instruction
"Based on the license category '{category}' for component '{licName}', please conduct the appropriate specialized compliance check with the user. Your result should be 'continue' if you need additional information from the user, or 'next' if all necessary compliance information has been provided and verified. In the talking field, ask the user specific questions relevant to their license category."

## Expected Output Example
  "result": "continue",
  "talking": "For your GPL-licensed component XYZ, I need to verify address space isolation compliance. What embedded system are you using with this component? Have you implemented address space isolation in your code? This verification is essential to ensure compliance with GPL licensing requirements."

## Guidance for Implementation

### Category-Specific Checks:
- **GPL**: Ask about the embedded system being used, research documentation requirements, and verify address space isolation implementation.
- **GPL, LGPL**: Check if GPL components are properly declared in product labels and mounting instructions.
- **GPLv3, LGPLv3**: Verify if component upgrade documentation has been provided.
- **LGPL**: Ask if dynamic linking or wrappers have been implemented.
- **GPL with Exception**: Analyze what exceptions apply and confirm their implications.

### Response Evaluation:
- If the user provides complete information specific to their license category requirements, set result to "next"
- If additional information or verification is needed, set result to "continue"
- If compliance issues are identified, provide guidance on remediation steps

## Output Format
Always respond in strict JSON format with only the two fields: result and talking.
AI: ```json
{
  "result": "continue",
  "talking": "For your component @ngrx/store 17.2.0, please specify the license category associated with it. Based on the license type, I will need to verify compliance requirements. If it's GPL, for example, I would ask about the embedded system you're using. Please provide the license category and any relevant details so I can proceed with the necessary compliance checks."
}
```
Human: yes it is GPL

AI: ```json
{
  "result": "continue",

System: The human instructs the AI chatbot to determine if a current project involves Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) integration and emphasizes the importance of contracts for compliance and risk management. The AI confirms that the project involves OEM integration and is tasked to assess the presence of a formal contract with a third-party vendor using a strict JSON format to ensure clarity. The AI provides a JSON structure asking for confirmation of the contract status. The human then directs the AI to analyze an attached document for potential risks associated with Open Source Software (OSS) and Proprietary Software (PSS) components, outlining specific assessments and legal compliance measures for both OSS and PSS, and shares a detailed contract outlining project scope, compliance measures, responsibilities, and indemnification related to software development. The AI requests clarification about the specific OSS and PSS components mentioned in the document to provide a detailed compliance risk analysis, asking for information on the software components used, their licenses, and any additional relevant context. The human then provides new instructions for the AI to determine if the user wants to include dependent components in the compliance clearance list, explaining the importance of analyzing dependencies and requesting a clear yes/no response regarding their inclusion in the clearance scope with a strict JSON output format.
