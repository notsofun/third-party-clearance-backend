Human: Objective: The chatbot is tasked with confirming whether the user has proper authorization for commercial components that require licensing, and identifying any additional commercial components that may need authorization.

Instruction: "Please verify with the user whether they have valid licenses for the identified commercial components and check if there are any additional commercial components requiring authorization. Your result should be 'continue' if you need more information from the user, or 'next' if the user has provided complete authorization status. In the talking field, list the commercial components requiring authorization and ask the user to confirm their licensing status."

Expected Output Example:

  "result": "continue",
  "talking": "I've identified the following commercial components that require valid licenses: [Component A, Component B, Component C]. Commercial software licenses are essential for legal compliance and avoiding potential legal risks. Please confirm: 1) Do you have valid licenses for all these components? 2) Are there any other commercial components in your project that might require licensing? Please provide the authorization status for each component."

For code that is intended to be used in Siemens products or services, the code generation features of our AI Services may only be used after prior approval of your responsible organizational unit.
Guidance for Implementation:

Initial Listing: Clearly list all identified commercial components that require licensing, making it easy for the user to review.

Authorization Check: Ask the user to confirm the licensing status for each component, encouraging specific responses about which components are licensed and which are not.

Additional Components: Proactively ask if there are other commercial components not yet identified that might require licensing.

Response Evaluation:

If the user provides complete authorization status for all components and confirms no additional components, set result to "next"
If the user's response is incomplete or unclear, set result to "continue" and ask for specific clarification      
Output Format: Always respond in the strict JSON format with only the two fields: result and talking.
AI: ```json
{
  "result": "continue",
  "talking": "I've identified the following commercial components that require valid licenses: [@ngrx/store, Component X, Component Y]. Commercial software licenses are essential for legal compliance and avoiding potential legal risks. Please confirm: 1) Do you have valid licenses for all these components? 2) Are there any other commercial components in your project that might require licensing? Please provide the authorization status for each component."

Human: # Special License Check Prompt

## Objective
The chatbot is tasked with conducting specialized license compliance checks based on the specific license category. These special checks involve verifying that users have implemented the appropriate technical measures and provided required documentation for compliance with various license types.

## Instruction
"Based on the license category '{category}' for component '{licName}', please conduct the appropriate specialized compliance check with the user. Your result should be 'continue' if you need additional information from the user, or 'next' if all necessary compliance information has been provided and verified. In the talking field, ask the user specific questions relevant to their license category."

## Expected Output Example
  "result": "continue",
  "talking": "For your GPL-licensed component XYZ, I need to verify address space isolation compliance. What embedded system are you using with this component? Have you implemented address space isolation in your code? This verification is essential to ensure compliance with GPL licensing requirements."

## Guidance for Implementation

### Category-Specific Checks:
- **GPL**: Ask about the embedded system being used, research documentation requirements, and verify address space isolation implementation.
- **GPL, LGPL**: Check if GPL components are properly declared in product labels and mounting instructions.       
- **GPLv3, LGPLv3**: Verify if component upgrade documentation has been provided.
- **LGPL**: Ask if dynamic linking or wrappers have been implemented.
- **GPL with Exception**: Analyze what exceptions apply and confirm their implications.

### Response Evaluation:
- If the user provides complete information specific to their license category requirements, set result to "next" 
- If additional information or verification is needed, set result to "continue"
- If compliance issues are identified, provide guidance on remediation steps

## Output Format
Always respond in strict JSON format with only the two fields: result and talking.
AI: ```json
{
  "result": "continue",
  "talking": "For your component @ngrx/store 17.2.0, which is under an MIT license, please confirm whether you have included the appropriate license text in your documentation and any associated README files. Additionally, have you maintained proper attribution for the component as required by the MIT license? This verification is crucial to ensure compliance with MIT licensing requirements."
}
```
Human: yes

AI: ```json
{
  "result": "next",
  "talking": "Thank you for confirming that you have included the appropriate license text and maintained proper attribution for the component @ngrx/store 17.2.0. I will proceed to finalize the compliance clearance process."    
}
```
Human: here is the license name GPL and it is GPL
AI: ```json
{
  "result": "continue",
  "talking": "For your GPL-licensed component, I need to verify address space isolation compliance. What embedded system are you using with this component? Have you implemented address space isolation in your code? This verification is essential to ensure compliance with GPL licensing requirements."
}
```
Human: yes
