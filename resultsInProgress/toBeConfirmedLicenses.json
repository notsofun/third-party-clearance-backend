    "title": "Apache-2.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache License 2.0 is indeed a permissive license that allows for broad use, reproduction, and modification without significant copyleft obligations. While there are conditions such as maintaining notices and a risk of termination of patent licenses under certain circumstances, these do not raise the overall risk level to medium or high. The requirements are manageable for most developers and organizations using this license, thus justifying the low risk rating."

    "title": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While CC-BY-4.0 allows for broad sharing and adaptation of works with proper attribution and does not impose copyleft obligations, there are still significant risks associated with use and compliance. The need for attribution and the potential for misunderstanding what constitutes sufficient attribution can lead to legal challenges and issues of misuse, which elevates the risk level from low to medium. Furthermore, comparing this license with others like CC-BY-NC-SA indicates higher risk categories, as those licenses impose more stringent requirements and restrictions."

    "title": "3: MITâ‡§",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is widely recognized as a permissive license without copyleft obligations. It allows for extensive freedom in using, modifying, and distributing the software. The risk associated with non-compliance is minimal, as the obligations primarily involve displaying the license text and copyright. Past evaluations of similar permissive licenses also support a low-risk categorization, confirming the original assessment."
