    "title": "Apache-2.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache-2.0 license is a permissive open-source license that allows for wide usage and redistribution without significant restrictions. Its lack of copyleft requirements means that users can incorporate the licensed code into proprietary products without the obligation to disclose their own source code. The obligations mainly center around attribution and maintaining notices, which are manageable and do not introduce significant legal risks. Given its established reputation and the reassurance it provides regarding patent licenses, the risk remains low."

    "title": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license allows for broad use and modification, it still carries an attribution requirement that imposes obligations on users. Unlike permissive licenses, it doesn't allow for complete freedom of use without conditions. Furthermore, the previous reviews of related licenses with 'non-commercial' and 'share-alike' clauses point to much higher risk levels due to their stricter requirements and potential limitations on commercial use, indicating that attribution licenses often come with considerations that elevate their risk compared to entirely permissive licenses."

    "title": "MIT",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is a permissive open-source license that allows users to use, copy, modify, merge, and distribute the software without significant restrictions. The only obligations are to include the original copyright and permission notice in copies of the software, which does not impose a copyleft requirement. This encourages widespread use and distribution without significant risk to the licensee. The risk level assessment of 'low' is therefore appropriate and aligns with the characteristics of this license as supported by the context information provided."
