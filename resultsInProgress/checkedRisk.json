    "title": "Apache-2.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive license that allows users to modify and redistribute the software with minimal restrictions. It includes requirements for providing attribution and retaining notices, but it does not impose copyleft obligations, which significantly reduces the risk associated with it. The context reinforces this assessment, indicating a consistent view across various interpretations of the license as low risk due to its permissive nature."

    "title": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license allows for wide usage and is generally permissive, it includes specific obligations for attribution which, if not adhered to, could lead to legal issues. This creates a medium level of risk compared to purely permissive licenses that have no obligations. Additionally, the existence of other CC licenses with higher restrictions highlights the importance of understanding the details and potential impacts of using CC-BY-4.0, warranting a medium risk assessment."

    "title": "3: MITâ‡§",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is a permissive license that allows wide usage, modification, and distribution of software with minimal restrictions. The only obligations are to include the copyright notice and the permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the software. This lack of copyleft requirements significantly reduces risk for users and developers, as it facilitates proprietary use of the licensed software without concern for compliance with more stringent licensing obligations. Given the context and consistency with similar licenses, the original low risk assessment is validated."
