    "title": "Apache-2.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache License 2.0 is considered a permissive license that allows for broad use, modification, and distribution of the licensed software without imposing copyleft requirements. This means that users can incorporate the licensed software into proprietary products without the requirement to disclose their own source code. While it includes some obligations such as providing attribution and retaining notices, the overall permissiveness and lack of stringent obligations signify a low risk profile. The previous evaluation aligns with this understanding, and thus the risk assessment remains validated as low."

    "title": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license allows broad use and modifications without copyleft obligations, the requirement for attribution and the potential interplay with other rights (such as moral rights, patent rights, and non-copyright restrictions) pose some risks that go beyond merely low. Additionally, the information in the context highlighting the risks associated with other Creative Commons licenses, such as CC-BY-NC-SA, indicates that there is a broader range of implications for creative works shared under Creative Commons licenses that warrant a medium risk assessment."

  {
    "title": "MIT",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is widely recognized as a permissive open-source license that imposes minimal restrictions on usage, distribution, and modification of the software. It requires the preservation of copyright notices and license text but does not have copyleft obligations that would require derivative works to be under the same license. The absence of warranty further minimizes risk for users, hence the assessment of 'low' risk level is appropriate and consistent with the justification."
