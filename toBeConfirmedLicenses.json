    "title": "Apache-2.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache License 2.0 is categorized as a permissive license with no strong copyleft obligations. The risk associated with this license is minimal since it allows for broad use, reproduction, and distribution, including modifications. While there are obligations to maintain notices and a risk of patent license termination if patent litigation is initiated, these do not significantly elevate the overall risk when compared to other licenses. The previous assessment of 'low' risk is consistent with the characteristics of the license."

    "title": "2: CC-BY-4.0⇧",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license does promote sharing and adaptation of works with attribution, the absence of copyleft conditions does not inherently lower the risk. Given the context that indicates higher risk levels for licenses with similar characteristics (notably CC-BY-NC-SA variations), it's essential to recognize that permissions under CC-BY-4.0 could result in extensive derivative works that may evolve beyond the original intent of the licensor, particularly in mixed environments where various licenses are at play. Therefore, the risk is higher than initially assessed."

    "title": "3: MIT⇧",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT License is a well-known permissive open-source license that imposes very few restrictions on the use, modification, and redistribution of software. The requirement to include the original copyright notice and the license itself is considered standard practice in permissive licenses. Since it does not impose copyleft obligations and holds the authors harmless from potential liabilities, the risk level remains low as assessed by the previous reviewer."
