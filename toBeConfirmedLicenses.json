    "title": "1: Apache-2.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The Apache License 2.0 is indeed a permissive license with no copyleft obligations, allowing modification and redistribution under flexible terms. The risk of patent termination upon litigation is a concern, but it is well-defined and limited in scope. Overall, the previous assessment of 'low' risk remains valid given these characteristics."

    "title": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "medium",
    "Justification": "While the CC-BY-4.0 license does allow for use and modification without copyleft obligations, there are still attribution requirements and potential liability concerns in the case of any legal claims regarding the underlying material. The lack of copyleft may indeed reduce the risk compared to licenses with strong copyleft provisions, but it's not without medium-level risks, particularly regarding liability and attribution compliance. Therefore, a medium risk level is more appropriate than low."

    "title": "MIT",
    "originalLevel": "low",
    "CheckedLevel": "low",
    "Justification": "The MIT license is widely recognized as a permissive license that imposes minimal obligations on users. The primary requirements are to include the copyright and permission notice in all copies of the software. It does not include copyleft obligations, which would require modified versions to be distributed under the same license. The context provided supports the assessment of 'low' risk, consistent with other MIT-style licenses being categorized similarly due to their permissive nature and minimal restrictions."
